# ðŸ“’ AFFiNE Mentorship Program

We generally welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to Affine and we will try our best to make Affine be built on the public. For those who would like to contribute to Affine while not quite sure about the skill needed, our mentorship program may fit you.

Start time of the first Mentorship Program: TBA

You may send your questions with your resume if you are interested, or apply to be a full-time team member at Affine.
